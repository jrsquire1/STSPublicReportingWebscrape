# STS Public Reporting Webscrape
This is a Python script that automates webscraping of publicly reported outcomes for adult cardiac surgery programs in the US as of 2022.

This project set out to look at publicly reported adult cardiac surgery outcomes as reported by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS), a leader in the US cardiac surgery space for quality and outcomes reporting. The purpose of scraping this data is to enable a cardiac surgery service line to see the current layout of their competitors, find those that perform better than average, and learn from their practices to improve patient outcomes.
